Have you ever wanted to know about the circus? Well strap in and get ready....

One day many, many years ago when I was a young lad I dreamed every night about going to the circus. There was nothing I wanted more in the world then to go to a circus, any circus and see the clowns, taste the peanuts, ride an elephant, and soak in the magic. After so many vivid, dream filled nights my dream finally turned into a reality. The Magical World Circus sent me a personal letter that was sealed with a magical stamp and smelled of pixie dust and possibility. The letter was inviting me to their circus. I couldn't believe my luck! I arrived at the circus at the exact time that the letter had specified and I couldn't believe what my eyes were telling me! THere were clowns and elephants and bearded ladies and trapeze artists and jugglers all about! I indulged in mountains of cotton candy, peanuts, and soda that streamed from fountains. THe ring leader named Dominic invited me to the middle of the circus to ride on his magical elephant named Stephan. Stephan and I instantly bonded and Dominic said that he would be so happy if I were to join the circus with him and become a professional elephant rider. Many years later Dominic and I are still an incredible team who entertain millions of children who shared the same dream I had. The End
